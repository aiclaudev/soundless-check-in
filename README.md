This is a check-in application that identifies visitors, especially effective during the COVID-19.

This application stores below informations in database
> Visitor's phone number
> Visitor's residential area
> Information of company that they visit

## Reason for making this application

The existing 'QR code check-in'  has the following problems.

* If the lens of the device receiving the data is dirty, it is not recognized well.
* If the surroundings are too bright or too dark, it is not recognized well.
* The process of accessing QR codes is complicated, especially for the elderly.

But, This application has no such inconvenience as using sound wave communication.
